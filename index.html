/*/ Written Questions!
1.
My dashboard provides visuals and statistics to effectively answer my boss's requests. My first graph essentially shows
the top 10 games of all time (based on sales) and also includes the feature of seeing the top game of a specific year.
My 2nd graph
essentially toggles on region, showing the "winning" genre for each region (in sales). This is super helpful as it is
easy to compare say
Action video games when looking at North American sales vs EU sales. This helps my boss see this information clearly.
Lastly, my 3rd graph
addresses the top publishers for a specific genre. I assumed that having the highest ranking game in the genre
correlated to the best publisher. I
also unfortunately had trouble with this graph (sorry), and was getting some bugs with showing the bars. Either way, my
boss is able to see
the top 5 publishers for each genre (if they look at the console LOL).
At a high level, essentially my graphs properly clean this video game data and organize it in a way to essentially tell
a story. With thousands of records, these few graphs tell a lot to summarize the data.

2. D3 was helpful as it provided a ton of tools to deal with a HUGE data set. To manually go and scrape through that
video game data set
would easily days and days. So D3 provides a way to summarize data (using the max function, using its many graphing
tools) and ultimately
helps someone paint a picture with data. It was also fun to play around with the many D3 tools and see how drastically
it changed your
perception on the data.

3. I think even though D3 has a lot of cool features, there are a bunch of drawbacks. For example, there are a lot of
things to
play around with that ultimately do not make it super straight forward when you are trying to paint a visual / picture.
Although there
is the possibility to have a dynamic graph / picture, it seems that there isn't much flexibility within altering graphs
(say if you
wanted to change a graph, it would have to be essentially completely re done.)

4. Evaluating the accessibility of my dashboard, a lot of people would have a tough time reading this dashboard and its
graphs.
The smallish font and the colors could make it quite tough for people that are colorblind or have bad eye sight.
Thinking of ways I could
improve this dashboard / make it more accessible, I believe I could add a audio component, that could describe the
graphs and the main
takeaways. This would significantly help the visually impaired. I feel that I could also do a better job in establish
the thickness of
my lines / bar charts in my dashboard, so the story / message of my graphs can be easily understood. It is quite crazy
to think that data
visualization (has visualize in the word) can be so easily transformed to accomodate any person that does not have a
perfect eyes, ears,
brain etc. I think it is super clever and makes sense why data visualization is so important now.

5. Ultimately what kept me from taking the steps to make my graphs / charts more accesible was the time and nuisance in
doing it. It is quite
obvious that making a chart readable / more accessible and even including an audio feature, takes a lot of time and
preciseness. This is not
so easy when you are coding in javascript (especially using D3, something I have never used before). It is also
important to recognize that
people want to take shortcuts and maybe not ultimately show the real truths in their data, and this can lead to them not
allowing their data
to be fully accessible.
